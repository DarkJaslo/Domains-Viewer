# Domains-Viewer

<p> 

Welcome! This is the first desktop app I made to watch [Domains](https://github.com/DarkJaslo/Domains) games.

It is quite simple: use the Domains standard output as this program's input (in many consoles, redirecting the input using a .txt file does the work).

It is a Qt application that uses OpenGL graphics to render the game. Quite the overkill, but funnily enough, it was by far the easiest option for me.

User guide:

-left and right arrows can be used to go a round up or down. This requires being focused on the window, you may need to click on it once

-spacebar can pause or resume the autoplay mode

-the slider allows moving quickly between rounds

## Build instructions

This is a Qt Application, so compiling will need both <tt>qmake</tt> and <tt>make</tt>. A release will not be out soon, but a web page that does pretty much the same as this app will. If you do not want to fight with Qt and building this, wait for it!
